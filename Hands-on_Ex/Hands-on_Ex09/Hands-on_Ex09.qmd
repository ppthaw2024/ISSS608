# **9 Modelling, Visualising and Analysing Network Data with R**

## **9.1 Overview**

In this hands-on exercise, how to model, analyse and visualise network data using R will be learnt

By the end of this hands-on exercise,

-   create graph object data frames, manipulate them using appropriate functions of *dplyr*, *lubridate*, and *tidygraph*,

-   build network graph visualisation using appropriate functions of *ggraph*,

-   compute network geometrics using *tidygraph*,undefined

-   build advanced graph visualisation by incorporating the network geometrics, and

-   build interactive network visualisation using *visNetwork* package.

## **9.2 Getting Started**

### **9.2.1 Installing and launching R packages**

```{r}
pacman::p_load(igraph, tidygraph, ggraph, 
               visNetwork, lubridate, clock,
               tidyverse, graphlayouts)
```

## **9.3 The Data**

The data sets used in this hands-on exercise is from an oil exploration and extraction company. There are two data sets. One contains the nodes data and the other contains the edges (also know as link) data.

### **9.3.1 The edges data**

-   *GAStech-email_edges.csv* which consists of two weeks of 9063 emails correspondances between 55 employees.

### **9.3.2 The nodes data**

-   *GAStech_email_nodes.csv* which consist of the names, department and title of the 55 employees.

### **9.3.3 Importing network data from files**

```{r}
GAStech_nodes <- read_csv("data/GAStech_email_node.csv")
GAStech_edges <- read_csv("data/GAStech_email_edge-v2.csv")
```

### **9.3.4 Reviewing the imported data**

```{r}
glimpse(GAStech_edges)
```

### **9.3.5 Wrangling time**

```{r}
GAStech_edges <- GAStech_edges %>%
  mutate(SendDate = dmy(SentDate)) %>%
  mutate(Weekday = wday(SentDate,
                        label = TRUE,
                        abbr = FALSE))
```

### **9.3.6 Reviewing the revised date fields**

```{r}

glimpse(GAStech_edges)
```

### **9.3.7 Wrangling attributes**

```{r}
GAStech_edges_aggregated <- GAStech_edges %>%
  filter(MainSubject == "Work related") %>%
  group_by(source, target, Weekday) %>%
    summarise(Weight = n()) %>%
  filter(source!=target) %>%
  filter(Weight > 1) %>%
  ungroup()
```

### **9.3.8 Reviewing the revised edges file**

```{r}
glimpse(GAStech_edges_aggregated)
```

## **9.4 Creating network objects using tidygraph**

tidygraph provides a tidy API for graph/network manipulation. While network data itself is not tidy, it can be envisioned as two tidy tables, one for node data and one for edge data. tidygraph provides a way to switch between the two tables and provides dplyr verbs for manipulating them. Furthermore it provides access to a lot of graph algorithms with return values that facilitate their use in a tidy workflow.

### **9.4.1 The tbl_graph object**

Two functions of **tidygraph** package can be used to create network objects, they are:

-   [`tbl_graph()`](https://tidygraph.data-imaginist.com/reference/tbl_graph.html) creates a **tbl_graph** network object from nodes and edges data.

-   [`as_tbl_graph()`](https://tidygraph.data-imaginist.com/reference/tbl_graph.html) converts network data and objects to a **tbl_graph** network. Below are network data and objects supported by `as_tbl_graph()`

### **9.4.2 The dplyr verbs in tidygraph**

-   *activate()* verb from **tidygraph** serves as a switch between tibbles for nodes and edges. All dplyr verbs applied to **tbl_graph** object are applied to the active tibble.

### **9.4.3 Using `tbl_graph()` to build tidygraph data model.**

```{r}
GAStech_graph <- tbl_graph(nodes = GAStech_nodes,
                           edges = GAStech_edges_aggregated, 
                           directed = TRUE)
```

### **9.4.4 Reviewing the output tidygraph’s graph object**

```{r}
glimpse(GAStech_graph)
```

### **9.4.5 Reviewing the output tidygraph’s graph object**

### **9.4.6 Changing the active object**

```{r}
GAStech_graph %>%
  activate(edges) %>%
  arrange(desc(Weight))
```

## **9.5 Plotting Static Network Graphs with ggraph package**

### **9.5.1 Plotting a basic network graph**

The code chunk below uses [*ggraph()*](https://ggraph.data-imaginist.com/reference/ggraph.html), [*geom-edge_link()*](https://ggraph.data-imaginist.com/reference/geom_edge_link.html) and [*geom_node_point()*](https://ggraph.data-imaginist.com/reference/geom_node_point.html) to plot a network graph by using *GAStech_graph*. 

```{r}
ggraph(GAStech_graph) +
  geom_edge_link() +
  geom_node_point()
```

### **9.5.2 Changing the default network graph theme**

In this section, you will use [*theme_graph()*](https://ggraph.data-imaginist.com/reference/theme_graph.html) to remove the x and y axes.

```{r}
g <- ggraph(GAStech_graph) + 
  geom_edge_link(aes()) +
  geom_node_point(aes())

g + theme_graph()
```

### **9.5.3 Changing the coloring of the plot**

```{r}
g <- ggraph(GAStech_graph) + 
  geom_edge_link(aes(colour = 'grey50')) +
  geom_node_point(aes(colour = 'grey40'))

g + theme_graph(background = 'grey10',
                text_colour = 'white')
```

### **9.5.4 Working with ggraph’s layouts**

**ggraph** support many layout for standard used, they are: star, circle, nicely (default), dh, gem, graphopt, grid, mds, spahere, randomly, fr, kk, drl and lgl. Figures below and on the right show layouts supported by `ggraph()`.

### **9.5.5 Fruchterman and Reingold layout**

```{r}
g <- ggraph(GAStech_graph, 
            layout = "fr") +
  geom_edge_link(aes()) +
  geom_node_point(aes())

g + theme_graph()
```

### **9.5.6 Modifying network nodes**

```{r}
g <- ggraph(GAStech_graph, 
            layout = "nicely") + 
  geom_edge_link(aes()) +
  geom_node_point(aes(colour = Department, 
                      size = 3))

g + theme_graph()
```

### **9.5.7 Modifying edges**

In the code chunk below, the thickness of the edges will be mapped with the *Weight* variable.

```{r}
g <- ggraph(GAStech_graph, 
            layout = "nicely") +
  geom_edge_link(aes(width=Weight), 
                 alpha=0.2) +
  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.1, 5)) +
  geom_node_point(aes(colour = Department), 
                  size = 3)

g + theme_graph()
```

## **9.6 Creating facet graphs**

Another very useful feature of **ggraph** is faceting. In visualising network data, this technique can be used to reduce edge over-plotting in a very meaning way by spreading nodes and edges out based on their attributes. In this section, you will learn how to use faceting technique to visualise network data.

There are three functions in ggraph to implement faceting, they are:

-   [*facet_nodes()*](https://r4va.netlify.app/chap27) whereby edges are only draw in a panel if both terminal nodes are present here,

-   [*facet_edges()*](https://ggraph.data-imaginist.com/reference/facet_edges.html) whereby nodes are always drawn in al panels even if the node data contains an attribute named the same as the one used for the edge facetting, and

-   [*facet_graph()*](https://ggraph.data-imaginist.com/reference/facet_graph.html) faceting on two variables simultaneously.

### **9.6.1 Working with *facet_edges()***

```{r}
set_graph_style()

g <- ggraph(GAStech_graph, 
            layout = "nicely") + 
  geom_edge_link(aes(width=Weight), 
                 alpha=0.2) +
  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.1, 5)) +
  geom_node_point(aes(colour = Department), 
                  size = 2)

g + facet_edges(~Weekday)
```

### **9.6.2 Working with *facet_edges()***

The code chunk below uses *theme()* to change the position of the legend.

```{r}
set_graph_style()

g <- ggraph(GAStech_graph, 
            layout = "nicely") + 
  geom_edge_link(aes(width=Weight), 
                 alpha=0.2) +
  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.1, 5)) +
  geom_node_point(aes(colour = Department), 
                  size = 2) +
  theme(legend.position = 'bottom')
  
g + facet_edges(~Weekday)
```

### **9.6.3 A framed facet graph**

```{r}
set_graph_style() 

g <- ggraph(GAStech_graph, 
            layout = "nicely") + 
  geom_edge_link(aes(width=Weight), 
                 alpha=0.2) +
  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.1, 5)) +
  geom_node_point(aes(colour = Department), 
                  size = 2)
  
g + facet_edges(~Weekday) +
  th_foreground(foreground = "grey80",  
                border = TRUE) +
  theme(legend.position = 'bottom')
```

### **9.6.3 A framed facet graph**

```{r}
set_graph_style() 

g <- ggraph(GAStech_graph, 
            layout = "nicely") + 
  geom_edge_link(aes(width=Weight), 
                 alpha=0.2) +
  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.1, 5)) +
  geom_node_point(aes(colour = Department), 
                  size = 2)
  
g + facet_edges(~Weekday) +
  th_foreground(foreground = "grey80",  
                border = TRUE) +
  theme(legend.position = 'bottom')
```

### **9.6.4 Working with *facet_nodes()***

```{r}
set_graph_style()

g <- ggraph(GAStech_graph, 
            layout = "nicely") + 
  geom_edge_link(aes(width=Weight), 
                 alpha=0.2) +
  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.1, 5)) +
  geom_node_point(aes(colour = Department), 
                  size = 2)
  
g + facet_nodes(~Department)+
  th_foreground(foreground = "grey80",  
                border = TRUE) +
  theme(legend.position = 'bottom')
```

## **9.7 Network Metrics Analysis**

### **9.7.1 Computing centrality indices**

Centrality measures are a collection of statistical indices use to describe the relative important of the actors are to a network. There are four well-known centrality measures, namely: degree, betweenness, closeness and eigenvector. 

```{r}
g <- GAStech_graph %>%
  mutate(betweenness_centrality = centrality_betweenness()) %>%
  ggraph(layout = "fr") + 
  geom_edge_link(aes(width=Weight), 
                 alpha=0.2) +
  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.1, 5)) +
  geom_node_point(aes(colour = Department,
            size=betweenness_centrality))
g + theme_graph()
```

### **9.7.2 Visualising network metrics**

It is important to note that from **ggraph v2.0** onward tidygraph algorithms such as centrality measures can be accessed directly in ggraph calls. This means that it is no longer necessary to precompute and store derived node and edge centrality measures on the graph in order to use them in a plot.

```{r}
g <- GAStech_graph %>%
  ggraph(layout = "fr") + 
  geom_edge_link(aes(width=Weight), 
                 alpha=0.2) +
  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.1, 5)) +
  geom_node_point(aes(colour = Department, 
                      size = centrality_betweenness()))
g + theme_graph()
```

### **9.7.3 Visualising Community**

```{r}
g <- GAStech_graph %>%
  mutate(community = as.factor(group_edge_betweenness(weights = Weight, directed = TRUE))) %>%
  ggraph(layout = "fr") + 
  geom_edge_link(aes(width=Weight), 
                 alpha=0.2) +
  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.1, 5)) +
  geom_node_point(aes(colour = community))  

g + theme_graph()
```

## **9.8 Building Interactive Network Graph with visNetwork**

## **9.8.1 Data preparation**

```{r}
GAStech_edges_aggregated <- GAStech_edges %>%
  left_join(GAStech_nodes, by = c("sourceLabel" = "label")) %>%
  rename(from = id) %>%
  left_join(GAStech_nodes, by = c("targetLabel" = "label")) %>%
  rename(to = id) %>%
  filter(MainSubject == "Work related") %>%
  group_by(from, to) %>%
    summarise(weight = n()) %>%
  filter(from!=to) %>%
  filter(weight > 1) %>%
  ungroup()
```

### **9.8.2 Plotting the first interactive network graph**

```{r}
visNetwork(GAStech_nodes, 
           GAStech_edges_aggregated)
```

```{r}
visNetwork(GAStech_nodes,
           GAStech_edges_aggregated) %>%
  visIgraphLayout(layout = "layout_with_fr") 
```

### **9.8.4 Working with visual attributes - Nodes**

visNetwork() looks for a field called “group” in the nodes object and colour the nodes according to the values of the group field.

The code chunk below rename Department field to group.

```{r}
GAStech_nodes <- GAStech_nodes %>%
  rename(group = Department) 
```

When we rerun the code chunk below, visNetwork shades the nodes by assigning unique colour to each category in the *group* field.

```{r}
visNetwork(GAStech_nodes,
           GAStech_edges_aggregated) %>%
  visIgraphLayout(layout = "layout_with_fr") %>%
  visLegend() %>%
  visLayout(randomSeed = 123)
```

### **9.8.5 Working with visual attributes - Edges**

In the code run below *visEdges()* is used to symbolise the edges.\
- The argument *arrows* is used to define where to place the arrow.\
- The *smooth* argument is used to plot the edges using a smooth curve.

```{r}
visNetwork(GAStech_nodes,
           GAStech_edges_aggregated) %>%
  visIgraphLayout(layout = "layout_with_fr") %>%
  visEdges(arrows = "to", 
           smooth = list(enabled = TRUE, 
                         type = "curvedCW")) %>%
  visLegend() %>%
  visLayout(randomSeed = 123)
```

### **9.8.6 Interactivity**

```{r}
visNetwork(GAStech_nodes,
           GAStech_edges_aggregated) %>%
  visIgraphLayout(layout = "layout_with_fr") %>%
  visOptions(highlightNearest = TRUE,
             nodesIdSelection = TRUE) %>%
  visLegend() %>%
  visLayout(randomSeed = 123)
```
